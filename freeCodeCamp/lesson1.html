  <h4>
    To create an internal link, you assign a link's href attribute to a hash symbol # plus the value of the id attribute
    for the element that you want to internally link to, usually further down the page. You then need to add the same id
    attribute to the element you are linking to. An id is an attribute that uniquely describes an element.
    Below is an example of an internal anchor link and its target element:
  </h4>
  <a href="#contacts-header">Contacts</a>
